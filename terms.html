            <h3>Applicability</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms and conditions of sale are the only terms that govern the sale of the Goods sold on
                parkersgamecubestore.com by Seller to the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a written
                contract signed by both parties is in existence covering the sale of the Goods covered hereby, the
                terms and conditions of said contract shall prevail to the extent they are inconsistent with these
                Terms. (b) The accompanying confirmation of the Sales Confirmation and collectively, this Agreement
                comprise the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
                understandings, agreements, negotiations, representations and warranties, and communications, both
                written and oral. Fulfillment of Buyer's order does not constitute acceptance of any of Buyer's terms
                and conditions and does not serve to modify or amend these Terms.[1]
            </p>
            <h3>Delivery</h3>
            <p>
                The goods will be delivered within a reasonable time after the receipt of Buyer's purchase order.
                Estimated delivery times on parkersgamecubestore.com are estimates only and not guarantees. Seller shall not be
                liable for any delays, loss, or damage in transit. (b) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties
                , Seller shall deliver the Goods to the Delivery Point using Seller's standard methods for packaging
                and shipping such Goods. (c) Seller may, in its sole discretion, without liability or penalty, make
                partial shipments of Goods to Buyer. Each shipment will constitute a separate sale, and Buyer shall
                pay for the units shipped whether such shipment is in whole or partial fulfillment of Buyer's purchase
                order.[1]
            </p>
            <h3>Non-Delivery</h3>
            <p>
                The quantity of any installment of Goods as recorded by Seller on dispatch from Seller's place of
                business is conclusive evidence of the quantity received by Buyer on delivery unless Buyer can provide
                conclusive evidence proving the contrary. (b) The Seller shall not be liable for any non-delivery of
                Goods (even if caused by Seller's negligence) unless Buyer gives written notice to Seller of the
                non-delivery within 5 days of the date when the Goods would in the ordinary course of events have been
                received. (c) Any liability of Seller for non-delivery of the Goods shall be limited to replacing the
                Goods within a reasonable time or adjusting the invoice respecting such Goods to reflect the actual
                quantity delivered.[1]
