                "The Nintendo GameCube is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. It was released in
                Japan on September 14, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, in Europe on May 3, 2002, in Australia
                on May 17, 2002, and in South Korea on December 14, 2002. It is the successor to the Nintendo 64. As a sixth-generation console,
                the GameCube primarily competed with Sony's PlayStation 2, Sega's Dreamcast and Microsoft's Xbox."[1]
            </p>

                "Nintendo began developing the GameCube in 1998 after entering a partnership with ArtX to design a graphics processing unit.
                The console was formally announced under the codename "Dolphin" the following year, and was released in 2001 as the GameCube.
                It is based on PowerPC. It is Nintendo's first console to use its own optical discs instead of ROM cartridges, supplemented by
                writable memory cards for saved games. Unlike its competitors, it is solely focused on gaming and does not play mass media like
                DVD or CD. The console supports limited online gaming for a few games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect
                to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable for exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller. The
                GameCube supports e-Reader cards to unlock special features in a few games. The Game Boy Player add-on runs Game Boy, Game Boy Color
                and Game Boy Advance cartridge games."[1]

            <!-- Product cards use the Gestalt design theory of Similarity, by using the same product card for each product,
             the mind discovers the patterns and easily groups the sets of information tied to each product. The area
             below each product image is also made to be white, a color not used in many other places on the site.
             This makes finding the next product on the page that much easier as the mind begins to associate the
             white block with product information -->
